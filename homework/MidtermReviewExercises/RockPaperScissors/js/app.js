//Generate random move for the computer

//If player chose RPS logic
    //Skip RPS logic, and subtract half a point from their score
//Else, run RPS logic
    //If player wins, add one to score
    //If player loses, subtract one from score
    //If tie, then do nothing

//Once logic is complete, show results of the round
